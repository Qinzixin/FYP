# FYP
This is the Final Year Project code repository for the project **shape approximation**.

Candidate: Zixin Qin

Type of study: Theoretical Study

# Developer's notes

- Implemented Functionalities
  - **replace_by_edge** done, rather trival (2021.1.6)
  - **replace_by_vertex** done, quite hard (2.9), design a test case manually
  - **get_boundary_edges** done,determine whether the edge is exterior 
        - problem solved: the formula only works when the graph is triangulated. (2.27)
   -  **generate the "ext point set"**, done (2.28)
        - use pointer, ideally not contaning global vairable
   -  **sort the edges**, done (2.28)
   -  **reveal** finished (3.1)
   - **remove edge** done, the edge must be sorted in "small-big" order (3.2)
   - **queue** done, the edges need to be stored in queue structure (3.2)
    - **edge_elimination** 
    -  basically able to run over input graph(3.3)
    - ~~However, there may be a bug: regular constraint, it  may eliminate more edges than expected~~(3.3) bug fixed(3.4)
    - ~~single vertex problem~~ solved(3.5)
    - the edge elimination only works for a single round (3.7) 
       - debug method: need to design specific sample input to debug (3.9 completed)
    - **anti_edge** function improved(3.10)
- Under implementation 
   - ** design experiment features**
     - record data size, running time, analyze efficiency
     - design 3 kinds of point set:
        - Alphabetic set
        - Shape set
        - Geography set
   - ** conduct experiment**
      

         - print out the triangulation simplices (To be done)
