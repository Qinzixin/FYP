Developer's notes

2021.1.6
- Is implementing the "find exterior edge"
  - **replace_by_edge** done, rather trival
  - **replace_by_vertex** done, quite hard (2.9)
  - *determine whether the edge is exterior* 
     ~~heart attack, the theory does not work~~(2.27)
     the theory only works when the graph is triangulated.
